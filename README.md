### Introduction
MAATool arises from the need to integrate and coordinate multiple perspectives in the development of complex projects. It is essential in European innovation spaces, where collaborations between different actors are crucial.

### Objectives
The main objectives of MAATool are:
1. **Comprehensive Project Management and Monitoring:** Provides a detailed view of project progress to facilitate informed decision-making.
2. **Detailed Record and Activity Tracking:** Allows thorough recording and precise tracking of project stages.
3. **Improved Collaboration and Communication:** Integrates all relevant actors into a single platform.
4. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Adapts to a variety of organizational structures and needs.
5. **Decision-Making Facilitator:** Provides real-time access to analysis and data.

### Challenges and Solutions
MAATool addresses challenges such as the variability of indicators between organizations and projects. The tool seeks to implement a generic evaluation system that considers indicators, records, and objectives, improving activity management and communication among team members.

### Application Architecture
The application is structured around several independent entities: Social Spaces, Stakeholders, and Users, each with specific roles and functions. Work entities can be linked to projects and contain users and records related to indicators.

### Use of Indicators
MAATool allows the creation and management of indicators, records, and entries that reflect progress toward specific objectives. Indicators can be numerical or textual and vary according to data entries.

### Key Features
- Project and workgroup management.
- Tracking of indicators and goal achievement.
- Improved internal communication.
